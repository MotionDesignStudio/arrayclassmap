# arrayclassmap
Iterate over a list or array to build a new list or array, using map as the iterator passing the value(s) to a class for computation without instantiating the class.  This is a direct violation of Law of Demeter.  I did this as an experiment to type less code in JavaScript when I discovered how to use this => .  This is replicated with multiple languages.
